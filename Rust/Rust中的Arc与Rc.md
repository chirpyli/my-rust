### Rc
单线程引用计数。不是线程安全的，如果需要线程间引用计数可用`Arc`。注意他们之间的实现区别。关键源码实现如下，重点可关注`Clone`和`Drop`的实现细节。
```rust
//! Single-threaded reference-counting pointers. 'Rc' stands for 'Reference
//! Counted'.

// This is repr(C) to future-proof against possible field-reordering, which
// would interfere with otherwise safe [into|from]_raw() of transmutable
// inner types.
#[repr(C)]
struct RcBox<T: ?Sized> {
    strong: Cell<usize>,    // 注意这里与Arc的区别，不是原子操作
    weak: Cell<usize>,
    value: T,
}

/// A single-threaded reference-counting pointer. 'Rc' stands for 'Reference
/// Counted'.
#[cfg_attr(not(test), rustc_diagnostic_item = "Rc")]
#[stable(feature = "rust1", since = "1.0.0")]
pub struct Rc<T: ?Sized> {
    ptr: NonNull<RcBox<T>>,
    phantom: PhantomData<RcBox<T>>,
}

#[stable(feature = "rust1", since = "1.0.0")]
impl<T: ?Sized> !marker::Send for Rc<T> {}
#[stable(feature = "rust1", since = "1.0.0")]
impl<T: ?Sized> !marker::Sync for Rc<T> {}

impl<T: ?Sized> Rc<T> {
    #[inline(always)]
    fn inner(&self) -> &RcBox<T> {
        // This unsafety is ok because while this Rc is alive we're guaranteed
        // that the inner pointer is valid.
        unsafe { self.ptr.as_ref() }
    }

    fn from_inner(ptr: NonNull<RcBox<T>>) -> Self {
        Self { ptr, phantom: PhantomData }
    }

    unsafe fn from_ptr(ptr: *mut RcBox<T>) -> Self {
        Self::from_inner(unsafe { NonNull::new_unchecked(ptr) })
    }
}

impl<T> Rc<T> {
    /// Constructs a new `Rc<T>`.
    #[stable(feature = "rust1", since = "1.0.0")]
    pub fn new(value: T) -> Rc<T> {
        // There is an implicit weak pointer owned by all the strong
        // pointers, which ensures that the weak destructor never frees
        // the allocation while the strong destructor is running, even
        // if the weak pointer is stored inside the strong one.
        Self::from_inner(
            Box::leak(box RcBox { strong: Cell::new(1), weak: Cell::new(1), value }).into(),
        )
    }
}

#[stable(feature = "rust1", since = "1.0.0")]
impl<T: ?Sized> Deref for Rc<T> {
    type Target = T;

    #[inline(always)]
    fn deref(&self) -> &T {
        &self.inner().value
    }
}

#[stable(feature = "rust1", since = "1.0.0")]
impl<T: ?Sized> Clone for Rc<T> {
    /// Makes a clone of the `Rc` pointer.
    ///
    /// This creates another pointer to the same allocation, increasing the
    /// strong reference count.
    #[inline]
    fn clone(&self) -> Rc<T> {
        self.inner().inc_strong();      // 克隆一次，引用计数+1
        Self::from_inner(self.ptr)
    }
}

#[stable(feature = "rust1", since = "1.0.0")]
unsafe impl<#[may_dangle] T: ?Sized> Drop for Rc<T> {
    /// Drops the `Rc`.
    ///
    /// This will decrement the strong reference count. If the strong reference
    /// count reaches zero then the only other references (if any) are
    /// [`Weak`], so we `drop` the inner value.
    fn drop(&mut self) {
        unsafe {
            self.inner().dec_strong();      // 引用计数-1
            if self.inner().strong() == 0 {         // 引用计数到0的处理
                // destroy the contained object
                ptr::drop_in_place(Self::get_mut_unchecked(self));

                // remove the implicit "strong weak" pointer now that we've
                // destroyed the contents.
                self.inner().dec_weak();

                if self.inner().weak() == 0 {
                    Global.dealloc(self.ptr.cast(), Layout::for_value(self.ptr.as_ref()));
                }
            }
        }
    }
}

```


### Arc
与`Rc`的区别主要是线程安全的引用计数。实现上最大的不同是用原子操作进行引用记数以实现线程间安全。但是需要强调一点的是，`Arc`共享引用的是不可变数据。如果允许可变引用，则可能发生在多个线程中同时修改数据的情况，这是不安全的，如果需要修改数据，则需要给内部数据加锁(例如：`Mutex,RwLock`)以保证线程间写安全，所以Rust的代码中经常会看到`Arc<Mutxe<T>>`和`Arc<RwLock<T>>`。

以下是`Arc`的关键实现代码，详细代码见[sync.rs](https://doc.rust-lang.org/src/alloc/sync.rs.html#207-210)，重点同样是关注`Clone`和`Drop`的实现。
```rust
/// A thread-safe reference-counting pointer. 'Arc' stands for 'Atomically
/// Reference Counted'.
///
/// The type `Arc<T>` provides shared ownership of a value of type `T`,
/// allocated in the heap. Invoking [`clone`][clone] on `Arc` produces
/// a new `Arc` instance, which points to the same allocation on the heap as the
/// source `Arc`, while increasing a reference count. When the last `Arc`
/// pointer to a given allocation is destroyed, the value stored in that allocation (often
/// referred to as "inner value") is also dropped.
///
/// Shared references in Rust disallow mutation by default, and `Arc` is no
/// exception: you cannot generally obtain a mutable reference to something
/// inside an `Arc`. If you need to mutate through an `Arc`, use
/// [`Mutex`][mutex], [`RwLock`][rwlock], or one of the [`Atomic`][atomic]
/// types.
///
/// ## Thread Safety
///
/// Unlike [`Rc<T>`], `Arc<T>` uses atomic operations for its reference
/// counting. This means that it is thread-safe. The disadvantage is that
/// atomic operations are more expensive than ordinary memory accesses. If you
/// are not sharing reference-counted allocations between threads, consider using
/// [`Rc<T>`] for lower overhead. [`Rc<T>`] is a safe default, because the
/// compiler will catch any attempt to send an [`Rc<T>`] between threads.
/// However, a library might choose `Arc<T>` in order to give library consumers
/// more flexibility.

        // This fence is needed to prevent reordering of use of the data and
        // deletion of the data.  Because it is marked `Release`, the decreasing
        // of the reference count synchronizes with this `Acquire` fence. This
        // means that use of the data happens before decreasing the reference
        // count, which happens before this fence, which happens before the
        // deletion of the data.
        //
        // As explained in the [Boost documentation][1],
        //
        // > It is important to enforce any possible access to the object in one

        // > operation after dropping a reference (any access to the object
        // > through this reference must obviously happened before), and an
        // > "acquire" operation before deleting the object.
        //
        // In particular, while the contents of an Arc are usually immutable, it's
        // possible to have interior writes to something like a Mutex<T>. Since a
        // Mutex is not acquired when it is deleted, we can't rely on its
        // synchronization logic to make writes in thread A visible to a destructor
        // running in thread B.
        //
        // Also note that the Acquire fence here could probably be replaced with an
